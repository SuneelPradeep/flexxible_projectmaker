here in layout.tsx we defined the children : React.ReactNode which gives us the type for the children as we are using Typescript
and using main is good practice is its our main content


using nav semantic tag of html is good as its nav and gives navbar and we are using the navbar in className which redirects to globals.css
<ul is unordered list and we can use it here to hide for the xl: flex hidden means hidden for xtralarge screens


g is schema generator and config is return in grafbase config 

in grafbase sample is g.model('User',{
    here name ,email like  : g.string().optional() or .required()
})
g.relation sets the User model to Project model and list() to tell its a list of projects  and search() means its searches through the categories if given the 
IN pathfinder grafbase  we have it creates those search and other funcitionalites for us

authOptions in session.ts has type NextAuthOptions

while giving google clientid in .env in session.ts  we can give in the end ! which means it may be empty for typescript to notice
we are giving async to navbar makes it server side rendering as the whole page is server side rendering without using usestate or useEffect something like that
